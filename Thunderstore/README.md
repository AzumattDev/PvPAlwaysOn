## Description

Remake of mine and TheDefiance2017's mod on nexus made again by request. This is a mod that is intended to be used on a
forced PvP server. This mod makes it to where PvP cannot be toggled by the player, and PvP is set to always be on.

The original mod can be found here: https://www.nexusmods.com/valheim/mods/448?tab=description

* This new version has version checking and server sync. Just in case you want to turn off from in the game (Using
  BepInEx Configuration Manager) or the server.

`**NOTE** This mod is meant to be installed on the server and all clients`

If you are installing this manually make sure you have BepInEx installed correctly then put the DLL inside the
BepInEx/plugins folder on both the server and client to enforce the PvP settings.
